 GTK+ 3.12.2 Build System v1 (cross-linux) 

 ----------------------------------------
 (well tested on Ubuntu 12.04 i686 chroot) 
  
 (To customize the process, edit the "vars.sh" script and modify :
   DISTRO = your Linux distro (ex : CentOS)
   ARCH = i386/amd64
   NATIVEPREFIX = where the intermediate native stack will be stored
   WIN32PREFIX = where the final win32 stack will be stored)

   First open a terminal and position yourself in this directory.

1) Run "2a_Check.sh" to check system and tools.

3) Run "3_PrepBuild.sh" to prepare the build directories & vars.

4) Run "4_Build.sh" to build the stack !
